# Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and be sure that your group has a `main` branch with this document and the entire [template repository codebase](https://github.com/david-gary/onlineStoreTemplate) either forked or downloaded and copied into your group's repository. If you have arranged to use a different codebase as a template, you do not need to have the original template included, but a `main` branch is still required.

## Introduction

We will be building a multiplayer Trivia bot with a wide range of features. This will include rooms, leaderboards, difficulty levels, and many more. This can used with individuals seeking ways to study, or even initiate a friendly competition

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

* **REQ-1: Multiplayer**
  * **Description:** The program will be able to create rooms for the user to be able to play with friends
  * **Type:**  `Functional`
  * **Priority:** 1
  * **Rationale:** It's in the name, this is a multiplayer trivia bot so multiplayer needs to be top priority.
  * **Testing:** We can test this by creating rooms and seeing if anything breaks when we start the trivia,
* **REQ-2: Different rooms with different categories**
  * **Description:** Our project needs to have different rooms where there will be different categories of trivia questions
  * **Type:** `Functional`
  * **Priority:** 3
  * **Rationale:** We need to make sure that the bot itself functions and one category works for us to implement different categories. 
  * **Testing:** We can test this by advancing to another room and see different questions.
* **REQ-3: Leaderboards**
  * **Description:** A leaderboard feature to add some friendly competition to the mix
  * **Type:** `Functional`
  * **Priority:** 3
  * **Rationale:** Need to make sure everything else works before trying to implement something that's not as important as multiplayer
  * **Testing:** We can test this feature by competing against each other and making sure that it sets the person with the higher score above the person that got the lesser score.
* **REQ-4:**
  * **Description:** A timed mode where it gives you questions and you have to answer within a certain time limit
  * **Type:** `Functional`
  * **Priority:** 1
  * **Rationale:** This requirement is a necessary need for the purpose of the Trivia bot.
  * **Testing:** Wether or not a timed countdown will be initiated.
* **REQ-5:**
  * **Description:** A presentable multiple choice mode
  * **Type:** `Functional`
  * **Priority:** 1
  * **Rationale:** The system will present a multiple choice format for the questions purpose.
  * **Testing:** Whether or not a series of answers will show up or not.
* **REQ-6:**
  * **Description:** A free response mode for open ended questions
  * **Type:** `Functional`
  * **Priority:** 1
  * **Rationale:** A mode for users to initiate in the trivia bot 
  * **Testing:** Whether or not users can answer presented questions freely in this specific mode. 
* **REQ-10**: Hint System
  * **Description**: A system that asks user if they need help after having tried a question a certain number of times.
  *  **Type**: Functional
  *  **Priority**: 5
  *  **Rationale**: User may not know the answer to the question and instead of choosing to move to the next question, they will also have an option to get a hint for the question.
  *  **Testing**: A test function that checks that the hint provided is same as the hint related to the question in the database of hints.
* **REQ-11**: Random select feature
  *  **Description**: A system which selects a random catagory for indecisive users
  *  **Type**: Functional
  *  **Priority**: 4
  *  **Rationale**: User may not have a specific category they wish to play in, and this feature selects a random catogory for them.
  *  **Testing**: A test function that checks that everytime a random catagory is begin selected when the user decides to activate the feature
* **REQ-12**: "Make your own" feature
  *  **Description**: A feature that allows the user to create their own set of questions and answers to play locally with their teammates
  *  **Type**: Functional
  *  **Priority**: 4
  *  **Rationale**: User may have a certain set of questions, with which they want to play the game and this function will allow them to do so.
  *  **Testing**: A test function that will check if the questions are linked with the answers that were provided by user, and a function which checks that only the questions provided by the user are asked.

## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

* **Neel**: The questions for the game will be pulled form an online database, who's API will have to be implemented in the project for smooth operations. Secondly the project template is of an online store, while we plan on making a trivia bot. We will have to make many changes to the template to allow us to create such a bot.

* **Justin**: With our Trivia bot we must enforce formatting as this can be subject of hindering results of the game. Another constraint can be debating which of our features will be completed at each phase. Time and bot input will be a dictating factor on this.

* **Anush:** 
  * **Constrain 1:** Something that we might have to deal with is the possibility that the questions might be a little too obtuse or difficult for the players. This might be solved with the hint system.

  * **Constrain 2:** The bot might not be able to recognise the answers given for the free response questions by the users. This might be solved by formatting it before feeding it to the bot to be checked. 


## Use Cases
